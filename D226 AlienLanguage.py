# This problem was asked by Airbnb.

# You come across a dictionary of sorted words in a language you've never seen before. 
# Write a program that returns the correct order of letters in this language.

# For example, given ['xww', 'wxyz', 'wxyw', 'ywx', 'ywz'], you should return ['x', 'z', 'w', 'y'].


# The idea is to create a graph of characters and then find topological sorting of the created graph.
# This is slightly above my level. I currently can't solve this 4.1 difficulty level.
